If this gives you a problem simply contact us and we'll happily refresh the link.\nQ. How do I print my download?\nWe will email you a download link - simply click on the link contained within the email, which also explains how to print the booklet and put it together.\nFor best results please print your booklet double-sided - if you can.\nChoose: Print Landscape (or Auto). Actual Size. Print on both sides of paper: Flip on short edge (ie Landscape, not Portrait).\nOnce printed simply fold in two to create an A5 booklet.\nIf you don't have a double-sided print option on your printer, then print single-sided, with options: Print Landscape (or Auto), Actual Size.\nCreate a back-to-back copy as follows:\nWith the outer cover on top, turn over the next page down (inner cover).\nKeep the next page as is (1 & 16), and turn over the next (2 & 15).\nKeep the next page as is (3 & 14), and turn over the next (4 & 13).\nKeep the next page as is (5 & 12), and turn over the next (6 & 11).\nKeep the next page as is (7 & 10), and turn over the next (8 & 9).\nSimply fold the booklet in half, with the cover on the outside, and the map in the middle.\nThis might sound complicated, but in reality it's dead simple!\nQ. When will my pre-printed booklet arrive?\nWe aim to post booklets the same, or next working day, using 1st class Royal Mail.\nQ. How secure is the payment process, using Stripe or PayPal?\nVery.\nHere is what Stripe say: \"Stripe has been audited by a PCI-certified auditor and is certified to PCI Service Provider Level 1. This is the most stringent level of certification available in the payments industry. To accomplish this, we make use of best-in-class security tools and practices to maintain a high level of security at Stripe\".\nHere is what PayPal say:\n\"PayPal delivers one of the most secure payment platforms in the world. After more than a decade as a leader in online payments, we’ve learned a thing or two about keeping your information safer. Whether you’re buying, selling, or transferring money, you get an extra layer of security when you use PayPal. That’s because all your financial information (like your bank account details and your credit card number) is securely stored and encrypted on our servers. So you don’t need to share your financial information with the person receiving or sending the money and expose your details online or in public.\"\nQ. My mobile version appears unformatted, what can I do?\nIf you're using Adobe Acrobat Reader to view the pdf file, have you set Liquid Mode on? If so, turn it off, and this will make it appear correctly. Go here for more info on Liquid Mode, from Adobe.\nQ. Are the walks suitable for children?\nYes - most children find them great entertainment. Younger children (primary school age) should always be accompanied by an adult, who is prepared to get actively involved - you can give them a particular role, eg matching pictures to clues, finding answers, or helping with directions, etc. If your children are very young, and in a pushchair, most walks still work well - the Wheelchair symbol against each walk gives a good indication of obstructions to overcome. We try very hard to make every walk pushchair friendly!\nQ.

Like Rob I have been fortunate enough to travel round many countries, but very few have the heritage & variety of the UK. Naturally I like the North best as Liverpool is the place where I grew up - but over time I've come to appreciate the South too (it's warmer & sunnier!). We've been to most of the big towns & cities in the UK, & picked out the ones we think are the very best. We hope you enjoy being 'Curious About' them too!  Sue\nIndividual Service - Curiosity Rewarded"
