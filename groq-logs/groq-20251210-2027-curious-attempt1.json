After more than a decade as a leader in online payments, we’ve learned a thing or two about keeping your information safer. Whether you’re buying, selling, or transferring money, you get an extra layer of security when you use PayPal. That’s because all your financial information (like your bank account details and your credit card number) is securely stored and encrypted on our servers. So you don’t need to share your financial information with the person receiving or sending the money and expose your details online or in public.\"\nQ. My mobile version appears unformatted, what can I do?\nIf you're using Adobe Acrobat Reader to view the pdf file, have you set Liquid Mode on? If so, turn it off, and this will make it appear correctly. Go here for more info on Liquid Mode, from Adobe.\nQ. Are the walks suitable for children?\nYes - most children find them great entertainment. Younger children (primary school age) should always be accompanied by an adult, who is prepared to get actively involved - you can give them a particular role, eg matching pictures to clues, finding answers, or helping with directions, etc. If your children are very young, and in a pushchair, most walks still work well - the Wheelchair symbol against each walk gives a good indication of obstructions to overcome. We try very hard to make every walk pushchair friendly!\nQ.
