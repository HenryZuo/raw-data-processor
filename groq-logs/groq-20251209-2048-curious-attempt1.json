Like Rob I have been fortunate enough to travel round many countries, but very few have the heritage & variety of the UK. Naturally I like the North best as Liverpool is the place where I grew up - but over time I've come to appreciate the South too (it's warmer & sunnier!). We've been to most of the big towns & cities in the UK, & picked out the ones we think are the very best. We hope you enjoy being 'Curious About' them too!  Sue\nIndividual Service - Curiosity Rewarded"
